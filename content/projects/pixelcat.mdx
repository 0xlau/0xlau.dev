This is a solution that encrypts video frames by generating a chaotic sequence, which swaps the positions of every two pixel points in the video frame according to the sequence, thereby achieving the effect of video encryption. 

This repository is a TamperMonkey plugin for video decryption, designed to decrypt and render in real-time the encrypted video frames on web pages, currently supporting the [bilibili.com](https://www.bilibili.com).
